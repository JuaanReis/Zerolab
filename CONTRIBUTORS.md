> If you really want to help, here's what you need to do to help this shitty server (I'm trying to be funny):

## Improve the code
Yes, it's ugly. If you know Python and Flask, feel free to clean up the mess. Just don't rewrite everything and call it "refactoring."

## Find bugs
They're everywhere. You probably don't even need to try. Just open an issue or fix them yourself if you're feeling brave.

## Add features
Have an idea? Implement it. But please don't suggest a dark mode before proper user authentication is in place. (Just kidding, any help is welcome.)

## Write docs
Nobody likes doing this, so if you do, congratulations—you're a rare breed (or you don't like programming, which is normal). Help the next poor soul who tries to figure it out.

## Create themes or templates
It looks like it was made in 2007. If you know HTML/CSS and have good taste, go for it.

## Break it on purpose
This is literally a playground for penetration testing and weird experiments. If you can break something creatively, congratulations—you're using it right.

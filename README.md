> *A server that typically runs on Python causes more problems than a pesky child*

## Technologies

1. Written in Python
2. Uses Flask for the server
3. HTML and CSS because I like websites (unless I created them)
4. sqlLite to store users (useless i know)
5. Maybe this server will work

## How to use?

1. You need Python 3.10.x (or higher)
2. Cloning this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JuaanReis/Zerolab.git
```

3. create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
> Maybe it's different on Windows (I don't remember)

4. install the dependencies (as I said, it may give an error)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run**
```bash
python3 run.py
```

## What to test?

> To save your time, test everything since I'm not an expert

*Add more stuff to this server which is definitely fast*

> If you need a tool to test this magnificent server, use the [vorin](https://github.com/JuaanReis/vorin)

Don't be stupid and post this online, open to the internet. <br>
The only WAF here is me and my laziness in fixing the flaws.
